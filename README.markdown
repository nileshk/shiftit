## Goals of Fork ##

This project was forked in order to customize how it works and add new functionality.  Currently, things like keyboard shortcuts cannot be customized, and the only way to change them is by modifying the source code and recompiling.  Here are some ideas of new features to add:

* Resize windows to a percentage.  For example, to resize a window to 60% of the screen, you would press a keyboard shortcut like Command-Alt-6.  This is the feature that is currently being worked on.
* Move windows to different monitors
* Configuration of shortcut keys.  This will likely not be user-friendly at first (e.g. reading in a file with keycodes).  It may also allow disabling of actions that aren't used.
* Easy keyboard shortcut for unminimizing windows
